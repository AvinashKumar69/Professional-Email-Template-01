                <p className=''>
                    A forced resignation letter is an official document stating that you are leaving the company. This document explains why the company forced you to resign and is a chance for you to share your point of view. A forced resignation letter should be professional and cordial despite the circumstances.

                    Hi [Name of your Manager or Supervisor]
                    <br /><br />
                    I regret to submit my resignation from my position as [Your Designation] at [Your Company Name]. <span className='font-bold'>My last day of employment will be [Month Date, Year]</span>.
                    <br /><br />
                    Due to the unforeseen backlash of last quarter's marketing campaign, management recommended that I resign from my position at the company. I am disappointed by the outcome of events, but I understand that [Your Company Name] is looking to reform its marketing efforts going forward.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am grateful for my time here. This position has helped me pinpoint my talents and my areas for improvement. I will use what I learned as a [Your Designation] in my future endeavors.
                    <br /><br />
                    Upon my resignation, the company still owes me [Number of Paid Leaves] of paid time off. The human resources department and I communicated this already, and they will add the equivalent payment to my final paycheck. The marketing team will take over all of my correspondence with clients and create a plan to move forward in my absence.
                    <br /><br />
                    Thank you for this opportunity, and I wish the company nothing but the best.
                    <br /><br />
                    Best Regards,
                    <br />

                <p className=''>
                    Hi [Name of your Manager or Supervisor]
                    <br /><br />
                    It is to my dissatisfaction that I submit my resignation from my position as [Your Designation] at [Your Company Name]. <span className='font-bold'>My decision to end my employment will be effective immediately</span>.
                    <br /><br />
                    I loved my time at [Your Company Name], but because of budget cuts, the Management can no longer afford my salary. I wish we could have worked out an agreement that allowed me to grow in my career, but it appears that circumstances will not allow it. I am forced to resign from this position and will look for new employment elsewhere.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am thankful for the past [Number of Years] years I have spent at [Your Company Name]. The students were respectful, and the staff was friendly. I will miss all of the people I have connected with during my employment.
                    <br /><br />
                    I accept the severance package the Management has offered me. The remaining custodians will cover my current duties until the Management finds a solution for the budget cuts.
                    <br /><br />
                    Best Regards,
                    <br />
